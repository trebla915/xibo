							<p>Editing a Layout gives you complete control over the code used to generate it on screen. </p>
							<p>You can use a combination of HTML and CSS to generate your display layout. These follow all the stand rules used for building a website.</p>
							<p>It is recommended that you use a text editor to construct your code and then copy and paste it into the tables on the page.</p>
							<p>The preview player allows you to navigate the presentations available to you and the slides available in each presentation. The preview window autosizes to your screen resolution. For true representation
							of how a presentation will appear on a screen, it is wise to set the resolution as close to the Display resolution as possible.</p>
						</div>
						<div id="terms_div">
							<p>Layouts use some designated tags that Xibo uses to identify certain custom elements. These are specified below</p>
							<p><strong>Name</strong> identifies the layout so that people can add it to a presentation.</p>
							<p><strong>Number of Positions</strong> identifies how many pieces of content can be added to this layout.</p>
							<p><strong>&lt;position name="1"&gt;</strong> is the tag that is used to define a position on the layout, where the number corresponds to
							one of the layout positions. So if you have 4 positions, you can have 4 of these tags, each with it's own position number 1,2,3 or 4.</p>
