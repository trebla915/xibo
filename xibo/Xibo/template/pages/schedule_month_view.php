							<h5>Xibo Calendar</h5>
							<p>All scheduling in Xibo can be viewed through the calendar. It shows when playlists are scheduled and on which displays.</p>

							<p><strong>Dates</strong>: The calendar months can be navigated using the Prev and Next links. They are either side of
							the current month/year indicator and the top of the calendar.</p>
							
							<p><strong>Add</strong>: Events can be added by either <br />
								a) Clicking the heading for a particular day <br />
								b) Double clicking within the day cell <br />
							Either method will open the Add Event form
							</p>
							<p>

							<p>See the "Calendar" section on Navigating for how to open the add/edit form</p>
							
							<h5>Event Details</h5>

							playlist selections and display selections.</p>

							every day for the next two weeks.</p>
							
							<p>To set recurrence for events select the required "Repeats" value from the list and the appropriate additional fields
							will be revealed. Select as appropriate.</p>
							
							<h5>Day View</h5>
							<p>The day view allows you to see everything that is happening on a display for that day. It gives a far
							greater degree of information than the calendar month view. This visualisation makes it easy to see when 
							events will overlap and share time on the screen.</p>
							
							<p>There are a number of additional features for the day view.<br />
							Firstly events shown on the day view can be loaded into the form for editing by clicking on the blocked out time.<br />
							Secondly new events can be added by clicking on start and end times in the last row - and then add new. The start and end
							times will be preloaded in the form that appears.</p>
